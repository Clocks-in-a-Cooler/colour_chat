## Setup for Node.js

First, make sure Node.js and npm are installed.

Next, clone this repository or download the .zip into a folder. (if you're downloading the .zip, remember to extract it.)

After, install a couple dependencies:

    npm install express
    
and 

    npm install --save socket.io
    
Then, start the server.

    node main.js
    
To test it out, go into your browser and type `localhost:3000`.
