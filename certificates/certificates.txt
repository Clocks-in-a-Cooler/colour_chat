For HTTPS, put some certificates into this folder.

You're going to need the following files:
privKey.prm -- the private key
newcert.pem -- the certificate

You'll get a scary warning yelling at you that the certificates are not good, but good certificates cost money (just saying).

If you're running colour_chat for private use, then just use openssl.exe (found on Sourceforge) to generate some certificates.
